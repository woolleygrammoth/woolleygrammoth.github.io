        But for the climate crisis, I would be satisfied on a purely 
        intellectual level as a theoretical particle physicist. 
        However, the existential dread weighs heavily on me and I can't 
        imagine not being a part of the solution. I therefore postponed 
        any plans for a Ph. D. and pursued a career where I would use my 
        technical skills to advance technological fixes to climate change. 
        I got my start doing analytics at New Sun Road, a startup involved 
        with solar microgrids in remote villages all over the world.

        My time at New Sun Road was cut short by an early pandemic hiring freeze. 
        A furious job hunt led me to ARISE High School in Oakland, 
        where I spent two years as the physics, engineering, and computer science  
        teacher. I learned a lot about myself and about the education system, 
        enjoyed aspects of the job immensely, and cherished 
        the relationships I built with students and fellow staff.
        But pandemic-era teaching was the hardest period in my life, and meanwhile
        my anxiety over the climate crisis continued to grow. I left ARISE in June 2022 and have 
        been seeking a role in climate tech ever since.

        During my last Spring at ARISE, I found a wonderful community of 
        similarly concerned and climate-conscious citizens of Earth through 
        the Climatebase Fellowship, a program to accelerate people's journeys into and 
        through their climate careers. The learning and the connections have been immensely 
        helpful in my climate career transition, but the enduring value I got from the fellowship 
        was that for the first time ever, I didn't feel totally isolated in my feelings of 
        existential dread. I'm not the only one fighting it constantly, as the Fellowship community 
        continues to remind me every day.
