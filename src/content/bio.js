        I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and have always had many interests—science, 
        baseball, music, math, swimming, volunteering, etc. I was always a 
        fast learner in all these areas, but never to such an extent that science, 
        for example, was an obvious place to focus and excel.

        During high school I was split between music and sports as a means to earn a scholarship 
        to some college, but neither really worked out. I knew I wanted to play water polo at a 
        California school, so I moved to SoCal to play at community college. I spent three years 
        working to achieve in-state status while taking classes and finally learning what really 
        drives me.

        Community college was a blast. I became obsessed with math and physics. I played college 
        water polo, taught myself the guitar, got into yoga, and spent endless hours at the beach. 
        After those three years, I applied for a third time to UC Berkeley, this time as a physics 
        major. I had finally found something compelling that I could really excel in, and Berkeley 
        Physics gave me the chance to grow.

        While I fed my fascination with physics, I also became more obsessed with climate change, 
        until I realized the urgent need for driven and technically competent people in the climate 
        change mitigation space. To that end, while physics will always feed my childlike curiosity, 
        I’ve decided that green tech is where I will spend my career, in the hope that future generations 
        will get to enjoy Earth in the same ways I have.
